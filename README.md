## Unofficial API

This project is neither created nor endorsed by Yahoo Inc.  Yahoo does not
provide any official API to developers, nor makes any guarantees regarding
service availability or API consistency.  In practice however, the open
source community has kept this project (and it's predecessor) working well
since 2013.

Nevertheless, we make no guarantees and you use this package at your own risk.
The developers (and obviously Yahoo) cannot be held responsible for any losses
you may incur as a result of using this service.  Use of this package is
considered acknowledgement and acceptance of these terms and of it's license.

## Quickstart

**CLI** (Command line interface)

```bash
$ npx yahoo-finance2 search AAPL

# or install it
$ npm install -g yahoo-finance2
$ yahoo-finance search AAPL '{ "someOption": true }'
```

**Importing**

```js
import yahooFinance from 'yahoo-finance2';

const results = await yahooFinance.search('AAPL');
const results = await yahooFInance.search('AAPL', { someOption: true, etc });
```

```

## (Optional) TypeScript Love

Working with `yahoo-finance2` is a joy if you're using TypeScript (but you
don't have to), with type checking and auto completion:

Try it yourself on our
[Live CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/yahoo-finance2-312x2?file=/src/index.ts).

## Using in the Browser (TL;DR; possible but unsupported)

This project is primarily developed to be used server-side in `node`.
Nevertheless, due to the large number on requests on this issue, we have
taken care to ensure the package can be imported in the browser too.

HOWEVER: you'll run into other challenges there that we can't help you with,
particularly CORS issues when trying to query Yahoo's servers in the browser
from non-Yahoo origins.  Since Yahoo is specifically blocking such requests,
we will not help you bypass them.  (One way around this is to run your own
server to proxy your requests, but we won't help you with this).
