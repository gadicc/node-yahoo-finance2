# setGlobalConfig

This util function sets global config options, merging with the defaults. These options are then the defaults used for every request. It is the **recommended** way of setting global config. Setting global config directly is not recommended.

## Usage:

```js
import yahooFinance from 'yahoo-finance2';

yahooFinance.setGlobalConfig({
    queue: {
        // some options here
    },
    cookieJar,              // see example below
    logger: { /* ... */ },  // see example below
});
```

Notes:

- Config provided to this function is validated.
- Options are merged infinite levels deep:

```js
import yahooFinance from 'yahoo-finance2';

yahooFinance.setGlobalConfig({
    queue: {
        concurrency: 2,
        // timeout is still set
    }
});
```

## Options

### Cookie Jar

Certain Yahoo APIs require various cookies to run.  By default, an
in-memory cookie store is for cookies.  This requires zero
configuration, however, it means everytime yahoo-finance2 is
reloaded (and that's A LOT on serverless), all the cookies and
consent flow needs to be executed again, which wastes time and
consumes unnecessary resources on Yahoo's side.

Yahoo-finance2 uses
[`tough-cookie`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tough-cookie)
internally, so any compatible cookie store may be used.  Here we
give an example of storing cookies on the filesystem (but for
serverless / edge, a database store would be a better fit):

1. Install `tough-cookie-file-store` with npm / yarn / pnpm / bun:

```ts
import os from "os";
import path from "path";
import { FileCookieStore } from "tough-cookie-file-store";
import yahooFinance from "../dist/esm/src/index-node.js";
import { ExtendedCookieJar } from "../dist/esm/src/lib/cookieJar.js";

const cookiePath = path.join(os.homedir(), ".yf2-cookies.json");
const cookieJar = new ExtendedCookieJar(new FileCookieStore(cookiePath));
yahooFinance.setGlobalConfig({ cookieJar });
```

This is the same code used in the CLI to store cookies in your homedir.

### Logger

By default, `console` is used for logging, but you can replace this
with your own custom logger, extending the default, e.g.:

```ts
yahooFinance.setGlobalConfig({
  logger: {
    info: (...args: any[]) => console.log(...args),
    warn: (...args: any[]) => console.error(...args),
    error: (...args: any[]) => console.error(...args),
    debug: (...args: any[]) => console.log(...args),
  },
})
```

## Options not documented elsewhere

    * `query1.finance.yahoo.com` serves `HTTP/1.0`
    * `query2.finance.yahoo.com` serves `HTTP/1.1`
    * [Differences between HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/246859/http-1-0-vs-1-1)

  * This option in particular may also be set with an environment variable of the same name.
