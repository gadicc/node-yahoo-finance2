              "reportTitle": "We expect S&P 500 earnings to grow 12% this year and like companies that increase their dividends at a 10%-plus rate. How does the AI marketplace stack up against those metrics? Pretty well. Argus has derived a model of the size and scope of the global AI industry, based on our coverage of major publicly traded players and most mid-tier players, along with our industry knowledge of private players. We estimate that global AI industry annual revenue amounted to $250 billion in 2024, and expect that to grow at a 40% CAGR through 2030, when total revenue is forecast to reach $1.8 trillion. The emergence of China's DeepSeek, which caused a broad selloff in AI stocks, is a reminder that this space is dynamic and unpredictable. DeepSeek is reportedly inexpensive and powerful in achieving certain AI tasks. While pricing is important, companies in the AI space prioritize relationships, continuity, security, and reliability. The top priority for companies using AI delivered as-a-service across cloud is to ensure that delivery is secure, fast, and reliable -- and adding new vendors entails risk. U.S. government policy is highly likely to prevent wide dissemination of Chinese AI models in enterprise technology implementations in the U.S., given risks of \"back doors\" to Chinese military and intelligence. Non-U.S. nations are largely following similar policies, which should inhibit acceptance of Chinese AI models worldwide. Finally, AI hardware leaders such as Nvidia and AMD also offer GPU software libraries, model training, and inference services tailored to specific enterprise AI applications. The AI market is large and growing, and new entrants are expected to continue to disrupt the market.",
